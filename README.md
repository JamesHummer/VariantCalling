A repository for my final GENE 5120 Bioinformatics in Python Final Project on CRISPR, where we looked at thousands of sites
in mouse cell cultures and analyzed chromosome 2 to see if they made the desired adjustment at 8 locations.

This required the following tools: Samtools, VCFtools, bin/bash/bwa, pandas, matplotlib, tar
For input, it used a .tar.gz file along with two fastq files, which was unzipped and the .fasta file was indexed
